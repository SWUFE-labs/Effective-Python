For example, say you want to read a file and return the mumber of characters on
each line.  Doing this with a list comprehension would require holding the
length of every line of the file in memory.  If the file is absolutely enormous
or perhaps a never-ending network socket, list comprehensions are problematic.
Here, I use a list comprehension in a way that can only handle small input
values.
